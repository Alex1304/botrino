title: Working with services
---

Services are certainly what contribute the most in making Botrino a so concise and easy to use framework. You will
hopefully understand why after reading this page introducing services and showing how to use their power to their
fullest extent.

## What is a service?

Services are more or less the same thing
as [beans in Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans). They are Java
objects that are instantiated once at the start of your application, and that you can inject everywhere in your app. A
service can define dependencies to other services, which are resolved when the service is created.

As such, the concept of dependency injection (DI) is also used in Botrino. Under the hood, it utilizes
the [RDI library](https://alex1304.github.io/rdi/docs/intro) which supports factories returning reactive types.

## How to use services?

Botrino will be able to find your services automatically in your app module, as long as your module is `open` and is
annotated with `@BotModule`, as explained in the [Getting Started guide](getting-started.mdx).

### Declaring a service

For a class to be recognized as a service, you need to annotate it with `@RdiService`:

```java
@RdiService
public class A {

}
```

With only this code, an instance of `A` will be created on startup. By default it assumes that a public no-arg
constructor exists, which is the case in the code above. But there are many ways to construct a service, and that's what
makes them interesting.

### Injecting a service in a constructor

Let's create another service `B`, which injects `A` in its constructor:

```java
@RdiService
public class B {

    @RdiFactory
    public B(A a) {
        // you can use A here
    }
}
```

The `@RdiFactory` annotation is what indicates the method to create the service, with the possibility to inject other
services in the arguments. In this scenario, the following will happen on startup:

* Botrino will find `A` and `B` in your module, and register them as services
* It will see that `B` injects `A` in constructor, so `A` needs to be created first before `B` can be created
* Services are created following the dependency tree.

### Injecting a service in a static factory

The method annotated with `@RdiFactory` can as well be a static factory method instead of a constructor:

```java
@RdiService
public class B {

    private final A a;

    private B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }

    @RdiFactory
    public static B create(A a) {
        return new B(a);
    }
}
```

:::caution
The return type of the static factory must be `B` or a subtype of `B`.

### Injecting a service in a reactive static factory

If you need to perform some reactive tasks in order to create your object, Botrino (in fact, RDI) allows you to return
a `Publisher` of the service instead of the service itself:

```java
@RdiService
public class B {

    private final A a;

    private B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }

    @RdiFactory
    public static Mono<B> create(A a) {
        return Mono.fromCallable(() -> new B(a));
    }
}
```

In this case, if `B` is injected somewhere else, it will first subscribe to the publisher returned by the static
factory, and create the service only after the instance of `B` is emitted.

dependency injection works.

## Built-in services

### `GatewayDiscordClient`

Maybe you've been wondering how to access the instance of the Discord client of your bot? Well, now you have the
answer: `GatewayDiscordClient` is registered as a service, which means you can inject it in your own services!

```java
@RdiService
public class A {

    @RdiFactory
    public A(GatewayDiscordClient gateway) {
        // you can use GatewayDiscordClient here
    }
}
```

### `ConfigContainer`

To access the values of the configuration file, the service `ConfigContainer` is registered and you can inject it in
your own services. For example, to get the bot token:

```java
@RdiService
public class A {

    @RdiFactory
    public A(ConfigContainer configContainer) {
        var botConfig = configContainer.get(BotConfig.class);
        var token = botConfig.token();
    }
}
```

We will see the `ConfigContainer` more in depth in the next section, [Configuring your bot](configuring-your-bot.mdx).
