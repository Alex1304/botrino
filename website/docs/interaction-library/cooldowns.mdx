title: Cooldowns
---

If your commands perform costly operations or can potentially be abused, you may want to set a limit on the number of
times the command can be used. The Cooldown API will allow you to deal with these situations without hassle.

## Set a cooldown to a command

Override the `cooldown()` method from `InteractionListener`, and specify the cooldown
using `Cooldown.of(int, Duration)`:

```java
@Override
public Cooldown cooldown() {
    return Cooldown.of(1, Duration.ofMinutes(1));
}
```

The integer represents the maximum number of times the command can be executed within a timeframe, and the duration
represents the timeframe itself. Therefore, this example corresponds to a cooldown of **once per minute**.

:::info
Cooldowns are applied **per user**. Two different users using the same command will always have their own separate usage
limits.

## Handling cooldowns

When a user reaches the maximum number of permits and attempts to use the command again, the command will fail with
a `CooldownException`. You can handle this exception via the command error handler, which will be covered in
the [next section](handling-errors.mdx).
