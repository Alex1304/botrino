title: Filtering and adapting events
---

Listeners are triggered when an interaction event is received via the Discord gateway. It is possible for you to
intervene between the moment the event is received and the moment the listener is triggered. This allows you to drop
some events to prevent any command from being executed in a certain context, or to determine which locale to apply
according to the event received.

## The `InteractionEventProcessor` interface

Create a class that implements `InteractionEventProcessor`. If you are using the Botrino framework, it will
automatically be set into the interaction service. Otherwise, you need to set it via the builder when constructing
your `InteractionService`:

```java
final var interactionService = InteractionService.builder(config, gateway)
        .setEventProcessor(new MyEventProcessor())
        .build();
```

Here is an example of `InteractionEventProcessor` implementation:

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.interaction.InteractionEventProcessor;
import discord4j.core.event.domain.interaction.InteractionCreateEvent;
import discord4j.core.object.entity.channel.GuildMessageChannel;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.util.Locale;

public final class MyEventProcessor implements InteractionEventProcessor {

    @Override
    public Mono<Boolean> filter(InteractionCreateEvent event) {
        return Mono.just(!event.getInteraction().getMember()
                .map(member -> member.getDisplayName().toLowerCase().contains("ignore me"))
                .orElse(true));
    }

    @Override
    public Mono<Locale> computeLocale(InteractionCreateEvent event) {
        return event.getInteraction().getChannel()
                .ofType(GuildMessageChannel.class)
                .flatMap(guildChannel -> {
                    if (guildChannel.getName().endsWith("fr")) {
                        return Mono.just(Locale.FRENCH);
                    } else if (guildChannel.getName().endsWith("de")) {
                        return Mono.just(Locale.GERMAN);
                    } else {
                        return Mono.empty();
                    }
                });
    }
}
```

* `filter(InteractionCreateEvent)` allows to decide whether to keep or to drop the given `InteractionCreateEvent`. The
  default implementation will allow all events. This method can be useful if you want to implement a blacklist system to
  ban some users from using your bot. In this example, we are filtering out users which username contains the string "
  ignore me".
* `computeLocale(InteractionCreateEvent)` allows to adapt the locale according to the event received. In order to keep
  the default locale, you are expected to return an empty `Mono`. The returned locale will be accessible via
  the `InteractionContext` (which implements `botrino.api.Translator`, see [Internationalization](../api/i18n.mdx)). You
  will typically store the locale in a database (either per guild or per user) and retrieve it here using the data given
  by the interaction event. In this example, we are interpreting the suffix of the channel name as the locale, with only
  French and German being supported. It will use the default locale defined in the [configuration](configuration.mdx) in
  all other cases.

:::caution Considerations when using the Botrino framework

* The implementation class must have a no-arg constructor.
* If more than one implementation of `InteractionEventProcessor` are found, it will result in an error as it is
  impossible to determine which one to use. If you don't want to remove the extra implementation(s), you can mark one of
  them with the `@Primary` annotation to lift the ambiguity. You may alternatively use the `@Exclude` annotation if you
  don't want one implementation to be picked up by Botrino.
