title: Handling errors
---

The execution of a interaction may fail for many reasons. You can handle these errors in a way that is adapted to each
type of errors, this is done via the `InteractionErrorHandler` interface.

## Global error handler

You simply need to create a class implementing `InteractionErrorHandler`. If you are using the Botrino framework, it
will automatically be set into the interaction service. Otherwise, you need to set it via the builder when constructing
your `InteractionService`:

```java
final var interactionService = InteractionService.builder(config, gateway)
        .setErrorHandler(new MyErrorHandler())
        .build();
```

Here is an example of `InteractionErrorHandler` implementation:

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.api.util.DurationUtils;
import botrino.interaction.InteractionErrorHandler;
import botrino.interaction.InteractionFailedException;
import botrino.interaction.context.InteractionContext;
import botrino.interaction.cooldown.CooldownException;
import botrino.interaction.privilege.PrivilegeException;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

public final class MyErrorHandler implements InteractionErrorHandler {

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> handleInteractionFailed(InteractionFailedException e, InteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("\uD83D\uDEAB " + e.getMessage()).withEphemeral(true);
    }

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> handlePrivilege(PrivilegeException e, InteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("You have insufficient privileges " +
                "to run this command.").withEphemeral(true);
    }

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> handleCooldown(CooldownException e, InteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("You are on cooldown. " +
                "Retry in " + DurationUtils.format(e.getRetryAfter())).withEphemeral(true);
    }

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> handleDefault(Throwable t, InteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("Something went wrong! Sorry for the inconvenience.")
                .withEphemeral(true)
                .onErrorResume(e -> {
                    t.addSuppressed(e);
                    return Mono.empty();
                }).then(Mono.error(t)); // Forward downstream for logging
    }
}
```

The methods of `InteractionErrorHandler` correspond to the most common error types. Each method exposes
the `InteractionContext` in which the error happened. None of them are required to be implemented, by default they just
forward errors downstream which will only log them at ERROR level. Currently there are four of them:

* `handleInteractionFailed(InteractionFailedException, InteractionContext)`: allows recovering on
  a `InteractionFailedException`. This exception represents a "normal" failure of the command, when the end user is at
  fault. This exception is generally thrown by yourself in your `run()` method and carries a user-friendly message, so
  the way to handle it will mostly consist of replying to the user with that message.
* `handlePrivilege(PrivilegeException, CommandContext)`: allows recovering on a `PrivilegeException`. It is thrown when
  a user attempts to use a command with insufficient privileges. Typically, handling this exception will consist of
  telling the user they cannot use the command. More details on privileges can be found
  in [this section](privileges.mdx).
* `handleCooldown(CooldownException, CommandContext)`: allows recovering on a `CooldownException`. It is thrown when a
  user attempts to use a command past the maximum usage limit within a time interval. Generally, it will be handled by
  notifying the user that they need to wait some time before trying the command again (the exception carries the exact
  time left). More details on cooldowns can be found in [this section](cooldowns.mdx).
* `handleDefault(Throwable, CommandContext)`: allows recovering on an exception type that corresponds to none of the
  above.

:::caution Considerations when using the Botrino framework

* The implementation class must have a no-arg constructor.
* If more than one implementation of `InteractionErrorHandler` are found, it will result in an error as it is impossible
  to determine which one to use. If you don't want to remove the extra implementation(s), you can mark one of them with
  the `@Primary` annotation to lift the ambiguity. You may alternatively use the `@Exclude` annotation if you don't want
  one implementation to be picked up by Botrino.
