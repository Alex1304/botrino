title: Creating commands
---

Commands represent the main form of interaction that Discord bots have with users. Creating commands is a simple and
straightforward process, with the ability to customize different aspects of them.

## Chat input (aka "slash") commands

### Basic command

A slash command is a command that is triggered when the user sends `/command-name` in chat. In the library, they are
called "chat input commands".

Here is an example of a `/ping` command that makes the bot reply with "Pong!":

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.interaction.annotation.ChatInputCommand;
import botrino.interaction.listener.ChatInputInteractionListener;
import botrino.interaction.context.ChatInputInteractionContext;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@ChatInputCommand(name = "ping", description = "Pings the bot to check if it is alive.")
public final class PingCommand implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("Pong!");
    }
}
```

* A chat input command must have a `@ChatInputCommand` annotation that contains the meta-information required by
  Discord (name of the command, description, defaultPermission, etc), and must implement
  the `ChatInputInteractionListener` interface.
* The `run` method accepts a `ChatInputInteractionContext` that holds contextual information on the command being
  executed, such as the original `ChatInputInteractionEvent`, the `MessageChannel` where the interaction happened,
  the `User` who initiated the interaction, and a `Locale` that may have been adapted to the target user (
  see [Filtering and adapting events](filtering-and-adapting-events.mdx)).
* Events are automatically acknowledged by default, so you can directly call `createFollowup()` without
  using `deferReply()` first (`reply()` will not work unless you disable automatic acknowledgment,
  see [Acknowledging Interactions](acknowledging-interactions.mdx))

:::info
If you are using the Botrino framework, you have nothing else to do, the command will be automatically recognized and
registered. Otherwise, you need to manually register it into the `InteractionService` like this:

```java
interactionService.registerChatInputCommand(new PingCommand());
```

:::

### Command options

A command may accept one or many options, whether they are required or optional. The library
provides `ChatInputCommandGrammar` that allows to inject the option values into a record class that is going to
be instantiated when the command is executed. Here is an example of a command using options:

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.interaction.annotation.ChatInputCommand;
import botrino.interaction.context.ChatInputInteractionContext;
import botrino.interaction.grammar.ChatInputCommandGrammar;
import botrino.interaction.listener.ChatInputInteractionListener;
import discord4j.core.object.command.ApplicationCommandOption;
import discord4j.discordjson.json.ApplicationCommandOptionData;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

import java.util.List;

@ChatInputCommand(name = "options", description = "Option testing")
public class OptionsCommand implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

    private final ChatInputCommandGrammar<Options> grammar = ChatInputCommandGrammar.of(Options.class);

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
        return grammar.resolve(ctx.event()).flatMap(options -> ctx.event()
                .createFollowup("Value of `my-string`: " + options.myString));
    }

    @Override
    public List<ApplicationCommandOptionData> options() {
        return grammar.toOptions();
    }

    private record Options(
            @ChatInputCommandGrammar.Option(
                    type = ApplicationCommandOption.Type.STRING,
                    name = "my-string",
                    description = "The string argument",
                    required = true,
                    choices = {
                            @ChatInputCommandGrammar.Choice(name = "Choice 1", stringValue = "1"),
                            @ChatInputCommandGrammar.Choice(name = "Choice 2", stringValue = "2"),
                            @ChatInputCommandGrammar.Choice(name = "Choice 3", stringValue = "3")
                    }
            )
            String myString) {}
}
```

1. Create a record class that declares the fields in which you want to inject the option values. It is recommended to
   use
   an internal private record for better code readability, unless you are re-using the same record for several commands.
2. Use the annotation `@ChatInputCommandGrammar.Option` on each record parameter to declare the properties of the
   option (the type,
   the name, the description, whether they are required or not, and the array of value choices, if any).
3. Create a new `ChatInputCommandGrammar` and pass the class to the `.of()` method. You only need to instantiate once,
   rather than on each command execution.
4. In the `run(ChatInputInteractionContext)` method, call the `resolve(ChatInputInteractionEvent)` method which will
   read the options, instantiate the record and inject the values in the annotated fields. You can then use the record
   object to conveniently access the values, as shown in the example above.
5. Override the `options()` method from `ChatInputInteractionListener` and make it
   return `ChatInputCommandGrammar#toOptions()`.

For reference, here is a table associating each `ApplicationCommandOption.Type` with the type of the field carrying the
annotation:

| Option type   | Type of annotated field                                                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STRING`      | `java.lang.String`                                                                           |
| `INTEGER`     | `java.lang.Long` (primitive `long` may be used only if `required = true`)                    |
| `NUMBER`      | `java.lang.Double` (primitive `double` may be used only if `required = true`)                |
| `BOOLEAN`     | `java.lang.Boolean` (primitive `boolean` may be used only if `required = true`)              |
| `USER`        | `discord4j.core.object.entity.User` (or `discord4j.core.object.entity.Member` if in a guild) |
| `CHANNEL`     | `discord4j.core.object.entity.channel.Channel`                                               |
| `ROLE`        | `discord4j.core.object.entity.Role`                                                          |
| `MENTIONABLE` | `discord4j.common.util.Snowflake`                                                            |
| `ATTACHMENT`  | `discord4j.core.object.entity.Attachment`                                                    |

:::caution
Optional options will be filled with `null` if not specified by the user, which means you cannot use primitive types
for `INTEGER`, `NUMBER` and `BOOLEAN` if `required = false`, otherwise you will get `NullPointerException`s.
:::

:::info
For legacy purposes, you can use a normal class instead of a record. In that case, the class must have a no-arg
constructor, and the `@ChatInputCommandGrammar.Option` annotations should be on fields declared in the class. Using
records is preferred as it allows for immutability.
:::

### Subcommands and subcommand groups

Discord allows to create subcommands and subcommand groups to help in organizing the logic of a complex command. Here is
an example of a command using subcommands and subcommand groups:

```java

@ChatInputCommand(
        name = "nest",
        description = "Subcommand testing",
        subcommands = {
                @Subcommand(name = "sub1", description = "Subcommand 1", listener = NestCommand.Sub1.class),
                @Subcommand(name = "sub2", description = "Subcommand 2", listener = NestCommand.Sub2.class)
        },
        subcommandGroups = {
                @SubcommandGroup(name = "group1", description = "Group 1", subcommands = {
                        @Subcommand(name = "sub", description = "Subcommand", listener = NestCommand.G1Sub.class)
                })
        }
)
public final class NestCommand {

    public static final class Sub1 implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

        @Override
        public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
            return ctx.event().createFollowup("sub1: pong!");
        }
    }

    public static final class Sub2 implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

        @Override
        public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
            return ctx.event().createFollowup("sub2: pong!");
        }
    }

    public static final class G1Sub implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

        @Override
        public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
            return ctx.event().createFollowup("group1 sub: pong!");
        }
    }
}
```

Here are the notable differences:

* The class carrying the `@ChatInputCommand` annotation no longer implements `ChatInputInteractionListener`. Indeed, as
  per Discord's documentation a base command becomes unusable if subcommands are present.
* The `@ChatInputCommand` specifies an array of `@Subcommand` and `@SubcommandGroup` with their own name and
  description.
* Subcommands specify the class implementing `ChatInputInteractionListener` that is going to handle them. In this
  example they are internal classes, but they can as well be external.

:::info
Here is how you manually register a command containing subcommands when you control the instance
of `InteractionService`:

```java
interactionService.registerChatInputCommand(new NestCommand(),List.

of(
        new NestCommand.Sub1(),
        new NestCommand.

Sub2(),
        new NestCommand.

G1Sub()
));
```

:::

:::caution
If you are using the Botrino framework, the subcommand classes must either have a public no-arg constructor or be
declared as a service. If the classes are internal, they must be `static`.
:::

## Context menu commands

Discord currently support two types of context menu commands, one on messages and one on users. It works the same as
chat input commands, but you need to use the `@MessageCommand` and `@UserCommand` annotations with
the `MessageInteractionListener` and `UserInteractionListener` interfaces, respectively.

Context menu commands are actually less complex than chat input ones, since there is no description, no options, no
subcommands... Only a name and a run method:

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.interaction.annotation.UserCommand;
import botrino.interaction.context.UserInteractionContext;
import botrino.interaction.listener.UserInteractionListener;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@UserCommand("Fight")
public final class FightCommand implements UserInteractionListener {

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> run(UserInteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("You are fighting <@" +
                ctx.event().getTargetId().asString() + ">");
    }
}
```

:::info
If you need to do manual registration, it happens
via `InteractionService#registerMessageCommand(MessageInteractionListener)`
and `InteractionService#registerUserCommand(MessageInteractionListener)`:

```java
interactionService.registerUserCommand(new FightCommand());
```

:::

## Commands as a service

:::info
The following is only applicable if you are using the Botrino framework.
See [Working with services](../api/working-with-services.mdx).
:::

Classes implementing commands can themselves be declared as services without any issues. For example if you need to
access the `ConfigContainer` in your command, you can do this:

```java
package testbot1;

import botrino.api.config.ConfigContainer;
import botrino.api.config.object.BotConfig;
import botrino.interaction.annotation.ChatInputCommand;
import botrino.interaction.context.ChatInputInteractionContext;
import botrino.interaction.listener.ChatInputInteractionListener;
import com.github.alex1304.rdi.finder.annotation.RdiFactory;
import com.github.alex1304.rdi.finder.annotation.RdiService;
import discord4j.gateway.intent.IntentSet;
import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

@RdiService
@ChatInputCommand(name = "intents", description = "Displays the intents enabled for this bot.")
public final class IntentsCommand implements ChatInputInteractionListener {

    private final long intents;

    @RdiFactory
    public IntentsCommand(ConfigContainer configContainer) {
        this.intents = configContainer.get(BotConfig.class)
                .enabledIntents()
                .orElse(IntentSet.nonPrivileged().getRawValue());
    }

    @Override
    public Publisher<?> run(ChatInputInteractionContext ctx) {
        return ctx.event().createFollowup("Intents enabled: " + intents);
    }
}
```

The command above accesses the values in the `config.json` to get the gateway intents enabled for the bot. You can
notice the use of `@RdiService` on top of `@ChatInputCommand`, this works totally fine! Don't forget the `@RdiFactory`
to inject the configuration container, and you're ready to run the bot and try out this command.

:::tip
If you declare a command as a service this way, you are allowed to do anything with it like any other service, for
example inject it in other services, or set up `@RdiFactory` to be
a [reactive static method](../api/working-with-services.mdx#injecting-a-service-in-a-reactive-static-factory) in case the
command needs to perform a reactive task in order to be initialized.
